# py2flask

This is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to input Python code and see the output of executing that code. The web application contains a form with a text area where users can enter Python code, and a "Run" button to execute the code. The application then displays the output of the code below the form.

The code begins by importing the necessary modules, including Flask and the regular expression library re. 
It then creates a new Flask application object and defines a template string that will be used to render the web page.
